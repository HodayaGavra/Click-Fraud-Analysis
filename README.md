# Click-Fraud-Analysis
Examples of fraud detection and prevention in online advertising data.


Click fraud is a deceptive and malicious practice that occurs in the realm of online advertising, particularly in pay-per-click (PPC) advertising campaigns. It involves the fraudulent clicking of online ads with the intent to artificially inflate the click-through rate or deplete an advertiser's budget, often resulting in financial losses and inaccurate performance data.

In simpler terms, click fraud is when someone, or even automated bots, repeatedly click on online ads, not because they are genuinely interested in the ad's content but to generate costs for the advertiser or manipulate the effectiveness of the ad campaign. This can happen for various reasons, including competitors trying to exhaust your ad budget, publishers looking to increase their revenue, or individuals with malicious intent.

Ultimately, click fraud undermines the integrity of online advertising by skewing data and wasting advertising dollars. Advertisers employ various strategies and tools to detect and prevent click fraud to ensure that their marketing efforts are as cost-effective and accurate as possible.
